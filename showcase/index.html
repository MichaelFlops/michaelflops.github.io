Razor sharp focus every rose I notice
My religion more women in power
I think mamma love a super power
Im a sucka though just a sucka for
Hyrlue herb, red alert, quick jab, bad meme, cute cat
Girl that make art with her hands yeah

Alcoholic I saw the pattern then I trained
My mental screaming I’d walk the plank
Walk the plan for my dreams
Type fuck
Barefeet on the coffee table highlife
Roller coaster no coasters for dad’s corona’s
Lows worth the highs highs come in 50 flavors
50 shades of mike

50 shades of Y

planning for tomorrow how you spend your time off
you're waitress waiting im a fuckboy taking my time
time the ultimate currency nothing has value without time
then why are you spending most of it in company we don't like

deep down in my heart I have a tiny heart
on again off otra vez march
I love you but you don't know what you're talking about
I love you but you don't know what you're talking about

like when I was small
like when I was small
knock knock knock
I live nextdoor
and every moment I see I see uniqueness
and I see suffering under your eyelids

I want a ball I want a ball
just to toss around just to toss around

so lets play tag with the neighbor kids
I'll hide in the trash and then pop out real quick
we're going to die soon so don't be a bitch
that's what life is I don't have perfect pitch
back when I was small I had no worries
when I was small I had no worries at all

<pre><code>we were dating in my head even though I'm tired tired
you were wandering like a pokemon
you would always lie high
in the grass just like a lazy snorlax
z z z you could be a butterfree

you came a running cause there was a spider
all up in your face face
I latched on quick like a bulbasaur
now we are face to face face
ho ho ho ho kisses are wet
ho ho ho ho kisses fucking sting

and moment you get out of that existential funk
the moment you stop seeing that punk
we can bond we can talk
and have a platonic relationship in the back of my bus
cause everything is cool and everything is great
when we live in a world where no one masterbaits
and if you go

just meet me halfway just please help me out

and I can surely talk the talk
but its you who can walk the walk
(oh oh oh)
be be my own my own easter bunny
just bite my ears off make the colors stop
just wrap your arms around me even as we sink
all the way into the bottom of the sea
and just be with me girl
I know I ain't so crazy
(oh oh oh)
be be my own my own jesus christ
be my lord and my savior tonight
I know I'll listen now because you're glowing bright
just sitting in my livingroom riding my bike
and Jesus Jesus why why are you riding my bike
(oh oh oh)
so be be a tooth fary fly in at night
slip me something under my pillow and take flight
banshees and mermaids are constantly surrounding me
in my everyday life am I the only one who sees
and I'm losing myself where am I I can't even tell

after 3-4 beers we're having a fight
cause you wanna play some monopoly
but be with me girl I'll monopolize your

I cum in late at night you look stunning when the lights
when the lights are not so bright
one step two grab myself a drink while you are watching TV
there's a man on the screen and he's telling me things I should eat
and also for medication so I can digest those things

until the mysterious end of her life life life
knife knife life life life
unlucky for me I haven't got a cousin whose attractive in the least
in the least
so I'll just pull a gregor mendel and be a sexual my whole life
I don't think I can handle that I don't think I can do that
oh ph oh ph FUCK THAT

and everyone is crazy and no ones in this town
closest possible candidate of the opposite gender
is atleast 30 pounds over weight in her waste

an answer to reason of why I sleep alone sleep alone at night
