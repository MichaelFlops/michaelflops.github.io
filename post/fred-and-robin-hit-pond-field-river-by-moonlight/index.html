<pre><code>next time I go out I teach God a lesson
next time I go out I teach God a lesson

gotta lesson from the trappist abbott
every actor an object of art
said in the word of God
the pen of benedict
is it a creed or creep
when he too vague to beg

gotta lesson from the drunk shaman
mantra of a thousand as of late
they my therapy today
I need it I breath it a clean slate
pero slate lake stop crying over lost tape
a la carte trip visit from edos
suddenly
I a monk
handsome youth having fun
god chose my temple
he chose the sword
I chose the pen
and his temple
well tortured to death
theres snow on his sleeve
I'll make a plan to fuck for a living
believe wouldn't' you
these discoveries my discoveries
bother the bishop cause I
gotta lesson

cant believe I sayin this
but I couldnt keep my shit
together I had to ruin it
plow it way matt shave his head
on the beat cant read kramer
kick open that door
cosbypolitics on the floor


cause next time I go out I teach God a lesson
next time I go out I teach god a lesson
next time I go out I teach god a lesson

too



you call me in my own headphones

she ate a chip off my leg
reinstate

i think too much
therefore Im too much
I tka her to write her affairs
I write my side of field
I hope it works in the shield
its dope I think its working
who knows i quit smoking
cept always writing, riding eception
only my music these days
seem to be only person that gets me
dont care anyways i calling the shots
my house my rules
get out this the no phone zone
this the go the fuck home zone
this the only way to spoon though
so my leg don't fall asleep
I sorry I meant it don't
eat that corndog
brian this time
jack next time
pero is going to see
me fuck by the end of the scene
