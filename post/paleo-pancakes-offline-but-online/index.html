anything less than you wouldn&rsquo;t send
she won&rsquo;t talk to me till
I 10 outa 10
is it worth it though
dumb bitch on a smmart phone
not impressed by whats real
unless you shove it in they pretty face
with the context
with the peel
suga mamma get me that kombucha
bart ride liek no otha
ride this privelege like a wave
ride it most don&rsquo;t know they racist
gainst racists its funny when you don&rsquo;t
care for definitions
intuituition
there&rsquo;s no dumb side
both sides think the other is dumb
am I right?
pentagon relased footage of a ufo
BART girl getting slaray for running gmail
like a fiend
gmail like a queen
for runnign gmail like me
for typing up a storm
that for free
when my lyrics are bottomless
I write more than any conquest
you imagined in your heart
without a full heart
I feel bad for you
with a full heart
doesn&rsquo;t matter though
cause whats more sexy
than a boy that focused
than a boy that know it
than a bot that focused
than a boy that know it
what more sexy
than a boy that focus
than a boy that know this
than a boy that focus
than a boy that know this</p>

<p>imma go and smoke
imma go and toke
with my robin bloke
and i know i not yoked
and i know i wont throw
and i know i gon go
and I know this dont make
much sense to you know
but the point that I pussy fotting
same point reason that you&rsquo;re down
I know I simplify
I know you won&rsquo;t follow
if I write it in song
so I blog it when I blacked out
cracked out too much coffee
on the daily wow</p>

<p>who could stop this lyrical beast
after all this I still rapping for free
double speak all I see
through simplified language
hyprocrisy
all up on the beat
all oup on the street
no one wants to care
with me
and I know I give dick for free
if she nice enough to me
if she challenge me
while being nice enough to me
but Im a masochist at heart sometimes
temperment volatile not wise
I know you know I know
I know you know I know
I know you know I know</p>

<p>I know you know I know
I wrote this without a beat
beat stopped I kept on writing B
break it downthe way she breaking glass ceiling
imma break it faster than anyone max feeling
i felt it all
and it a wonder though
and it a wonder still
so many pretty people
why you nervous bitch
cant compete with it
only person you lying to
is yourself
therefore you lying to everyone around you
sorry i said it i meant it
caps lock on when I typing
while drunk or high
only time id admit it through song and verse
verses til the day I die
chorus till I get stuck</p>

<p>the beat started on bart
front like i run a full house of cards
id never see it
main strategy same as my</p>

<p>if I dont have a phone
and I think it lit
think I gonna ruin it
with this instagram bitch
no Imma tell what she wanna know
and not confuse her too much
imma show you a good time
timberlake in my mind
m study and focus
apolsky only one that sees through this
without meeting him ill interview when I done with the ragged shit
cause i not done busing&rsquo; my cartilege
max those millimeters on that cartilege
ill bate in public if I get a switch
see if I qualify for some extra cheese
see if I qualify for that light beef
shred only if it a burrito bowl
lie only if she wanna go
fight only if I wanna know
the bounds of my strength
or someone&rsquo;s tryin to kill me today
what the difference
main emotion indeifference
god out for cigs
media out for cigs
only fam that understand me
are my memes
only fam that understands me</p>

<p>who knows though</p>

<p>i hope to talk to her yo
cause I miss a good convo
nothing bout it sexual
cept the fac that she hot
cept the fact that she smart
nothing to it
just play it cool
passion my best friend
passion got me here in the first place man
passion mbetter than you&rsquo;ll ever know
passion harder than you&rsquo;ll ever flow</p>

<p>who knows though</p>

<p>i don&rsquo;t give a fuck
get fucked
get fucked up
dont give a fuck</p>

<p>find me only on riot
talking real shit with only the kindest
not a dick measuring contest</p>

<p>cryptic flow infected my mindset
briconomu infected my mindset</p>

<p>world my stage tho i feel more a prop
clues ive learned from view in rearview mob
my tongue blunt tool
my tongue she like on pop
world my stage
tho I feel more a prop</p>

<p>think of life like a book
that my hook
i the main character so I act like it
caesar said the world your stage</p>

<p>and I said imma get off in two stops
even though I know the difference in the drop
and i know imma reach for the stars
even though i smarter than the mob
not harder to be smarter than the mob
second tuesday of each month
get that therapy you need
myself dont need a beat
when you rapping with me
doesnt mean we a thing
just means im me
stuck in the glass
or being a disciple
of something bigger than me
bigger than your pussy
stronger than a roofie
soemthign in her herpies
none of it to me
i ride it std free
contribute it to breathing
meditating on the daily
i the next stop
i michael flops
peace to you
milo I love you WHAT</p>
