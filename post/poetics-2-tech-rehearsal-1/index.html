It&amp;rsquo;s funny, I feel I could be a lot more help to jack if he wasn&amp;rsquo;t being so horrible to me, but I don&amp;rsquo;t take it personally cause he&amp;rsquo;s being mean to everyone else. He&amp;rsquo;s just stressed." />

<p><strong>250 pm</strong></p>

<p>@ rehearsal, its the ale boys scene so I have a second to type.</p>

<p>Michael H and Marina just left, we&rsquo;ve been practicing since 10 AM.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s funny, I feel I could be a lot more help to jack if he wasn&rsquo;t being so horrible to me, but I don&rsquo;t take it personally cause he&rsquo;s being mean to everyone else. He&rsquo;s just stressed. He should stick to writing, or get a dumber cast. But I just say that cause I&rsquo;m mad - he should really just empathize with everyone a bit more.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s cute when people get real smart in one thing, but lose the other more fundamental skills along the way. The same shit happens to me. For example when I spend a weekend on hacking some shit, there&rsquo;s certain friends I can&rsquo;t really interface with cause my autistic bar gets maxed out. Who knows what will happen, but I will say this is the last play I want to work on with Jack, cause it could be so much better if he was just a little bit different. If he treated people a bit better. But I said that during the last play so I could just as easily keep doing plays with Jack for the rest of my life. Who knows what will happen. It&rsquo;s just when you&rsquo;re doing it, you hate each other?</p>

<p>He said he was envious / jealous of my lady skills. My lady skills aren&rsquo;t even that great! I just like people in general, and that is attractive or something.</p>

<p>real bottom line I love him a lot and its worth the abuse</p>

<p>and even if he never learns it&rsquo;s still better to stick around.</p>

<p>I love the fact that my last line in the play is &lsquo;I know&rsquo; - I&rsquo;m a big fan of that. This whole experience is great.</p>

<p>Bottom line I think if Jack does a dose with me, he might be able to see that there&rsquo;s nothing to be jealous about with me. the dose would show him there&rsquo;s no good reason to be jealous of anyone in the first place. You don&rsquo;t need a dose to see that. But you might need a dose to intimately know it, to change your brain so even your knee-jerk responses are altered for the better.</p>

<p>I haven&rsquo;t had any caffeine today and it feels weird! Can&rsquo;t remember the last time I&rsquo;ve been not on caffeine this late in the day.</p>

<p>Luckily there&rsquo;s a piano here. I want to play it by the end of the day.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll record that part at least. I smoked a stoge 10 minutes ago but already regret it. Just wish I had a coffee to go with it.</p>
