<p>listening to poetics 2 rehearsal tape.</p>

<pre><code>[[ paleblue beatz despression ]]
well i already made all the music
for the entire planet

the therapy couch taught me
by taking me by hand
</code></pre>

<p>getting a set together for the 6th, going to Vina tomorrow to tour everything monk life</p>

<h2 id="ch-36">ch 36:</h2>

<p>my final scene, the person is led to believe that it&rsquo;s not my last scene, but Im behaving as if its my last scene
chamber 36
my final scene
something about it bein my last
that being important</p>

<p>tongiht i just need to meditate to some of my tunes honestly at this point</p>

<p>that&rsquo;s crazy</p>

<p>just had a long talk on the couch with ted - cam was working on the music cues&hellip;. much love to both of them, I can only communicate certain things with them, and it&rsquo;s a treasure to be able to do so.</p>

<p><strong>1211 am</strong></p>

<p>alrght fuck this im going to be candid finally</p>

<p>no more pussy footing around it</p>

<p>i flat out wont admit only one thing im aware of</p>

<p>but i will admit that i lost some focus muscles today&hellip;.</p>

<p>my gopro didn&rsquo;t have the SD card in it and my recorder died on me. the recorder died right as Denis and I were conversing on some bench in koshland park (I think its called that) a year ago. So we were making the reunion tape</p>

<p>now that makes me wanna be obsessed with reunion tapes</p>

<pre><code>now i understand love

now i understand love
i don't care who you're with
now that I understand love
there i said it i meant it

</code></pre>

<p>who could stop me from making more? only myself. And damn now that I have the computer, do I have the focus? it was real great hitting noisebridge today- they really upped the vibe. There&rsquo;s 2 music making stations that are new, among other things.</p>

<p>I love it
I cant wait to make more stuff there</p>

<p>but to speak more candid</p>

<p>theres a lot of tensionbetween jack and I</p>

<p>and he&rsquo;s being a total dick and he can&rsquo;t seem to control it
ill give him a healthy dose</p>

<p>so what can I say?
today was more of a therapy day</p>

<p>for sure</p>

<p>had a last with dennis
just two young men walking around san francisco
we found two other parks and played with a bouncy ball
it was a dream
he bought me a carne asada burrito and club mate tea
and</p>

<p>wtf am i listening to my tunes omg</p>

<p>my tunes are a lot better tan i remember from like a month ago</p>

<p><strong>1226 am</strong></p>

<p>time is going by really really slow right now.</p>

<pre><code> it's a little known fact
 if you keep singing
 you will be rewarded
 just keep singing
 idk I'm tempted to get dev up on VR chat
 but I gotta save that
 I gotta make a set first
 then I can go play that

 who knows
 I know
 i have huge dreams
 pointless me
 without my dreams
 i incomplete
 without my dreams
 i get mean
 without my dreams
 so you wanna take me out now

 lost in

 oh wait
 more volume all i need
 sometimes when i freestyle
 sometimes when i feel yall
 finish a set so you can feel
 yall
 finish a set so you can feeeeeeeellllll ya'Copyright (c) 2018 Copyright Holder All Rights Reserved.
