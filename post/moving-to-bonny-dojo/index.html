<p><strong>1029AM.Davis.CA</strong></p>

<p>Briconomu and I are moving to SC today! She&rsquo;s making paleo pancakes right now. Listening to Herbie Hancock.</p>

<p>I look</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m moving the audio from the poetics rehearsals onto a recorder.</p>

<p>I gotta get cameron&rsquo;s pws so I can bum off his servers for this site - an old client I don&rsquo;t talk to anymore seems to have cancelled their getforge hosting with me so everything&rsquo;s about to fall offline.</p>

<p>today marks a new chapter in my life that I&rsquo;m so excited for. I feel like this is just like moving up Empire Grade, but where I failed at Empire I can be successful at the Bonny Dojo. I&rsquo;m going to get everyone focused and working together cause that&rsquo;s the most fun and rewarding way to do it, and based off the vibes last time I went there. I should just do 1 stream a week starting out, or like the same time every day. Hypothetical House is the perfect place for VR chat. ahahahaha.</p>

<p>Yesterday a public defender that lives here talked to two people that were going to be in jail for a long time. I wished I asked Kendra what they talked about, how the interaction went.</p>

<hr />

<pre><code>already wrote my own bible
buried it in the woods
you'll never find it
till death take me
till death takes you



damn craig
sally would eat your soul
if you put on a plate
way she typing to mate
what happened to isabella
I wanted to hear some broken English
that straight inspiration
better than adderall n vaping
Im just cheesing
sorry every player has their day
and today you were the player that got played

<p><strong>1214PM</strong></p>

<pre><code>get to that laser cutter michael

and make your first
[cont]
</code></pre>

<p><h1> first function box </h1></p>

<pre><code>look at any random living room

and imagine if you were to make one small piece out of wood

and how it could be used as a conversation topic

and what people would say about it
</code></pre>

<p><strong>249</strong></p>

<p>the <h1>&gt; first item </h1> to go in the uhaul was the telescope.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve never used it, but it&rsquo;s been around. It was used in the last play we did.</p>

<p>I look forward to setting up the telescope on the deck though. I wonder if there&rsquo;s a cool way to live stream with a mobile rig, without having to use a phone. That would be nice.</p>

<p>I think because I look up when I feel lost</p>

<p>and I don&rsquo;t feel that lost, just confused and inquistitive.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m surprising myself, this feels significant</p>

<p>had blaze pizza, a toke, a cotton candy bang and my homestasis has been achieved.</p>

<p>I feel a profound peace. It&rsquo;s working.</p>

<p>I lied about the telescope being the first item. Technically I put my circuits suitcase in the cab, I don&rsquo;t like the idea of my electronics getting bumped around too much.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s an old suitcase my parent&rsquo;s used, and I think it brings me +18 Joy points</p>

<p>when I&rsquo;m touching it. Plus I&rsquo;m not that great at electronics and it serves as a good luck token. ok now back to moving, and harvey the little black <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> lab <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> chihuaua is sniffing my leg.</p>

<h2 id="given-the-season">GIVEN THE SEASON</h2>

<p>for me</p>

<p>why is it taking me so long to attain a solid understanding of my response to weather</p>

<p>guess that&rsquo;s what they mean</p>

<p>when it comes to expoerience</p>

<p>and that&rsquo;s why I love speaking with old people</p>

<p>they are my therapy today.</p>

<p>Met this lady Davis at Blaze Pizza in Davis. She told me this book changed her life</p>

<p>let me remember, please</p>

<p>alvin <em>something</em></p>

<pre><code>    godDamnitt
</code></pre>

<p>It was a book written 40 years ago by her estimation.</p>

<p>She read it 40 years ago and it changed her life. She mentioned it 2 minutes deep into a conversation with a stranger while ordering pizza.</p>

<p>She got the cauliflower crust for an extra 2.50. Does it matter.</p>

<p>Look in the mirror and say does this face matter? a thousand times</p>

<p>I like to alternate the words, it&rsquo;s rewarding to ask sounding like an assertion</p>

<pre><code>    does this face fucking matter?
</code></pre>

<p>The author Alvin (still can&rsquo;t remember his last name) predicted a lot of technoigcal and societal changes, Davis told me.</p>

<hr />

<p>yeah I&rsquo;m pretty high</p>

<p>but at least I&rsquo;m doing something with my life</p>

<p>I just got a painting in the back of a uHaul</p>

<pre><code>sweep yo mammas porch
mamma told me

showing love towards an

ambivalent god

<p>who is on top of the chain</p>

<p>some say time</p>

<p>is top of the chain</p>

<p>but how could time be top of the chain</p>

<p>when time ceases to exist in a black hole?</p>

<p>who is top of the chain</p>

<p>do you have to give up who</p>

<p>in order to be top of the chain</p>

<p>like some graffiti art on BART train</p>
