<h3 id="chbs">chbs</h3>

<p>we&rsquo;re going through my dying process.</p>

<p>starts with the show</p>

<p>the last show</p>

<p>the encore</p>

<p>dying in the encore</p>

<p>no its a hallucination of my dying process, in it is a tour of humanity</p>

<p>and everything in between</p>

<p>chbs</p>

<p>[1]  a show
[2] architecture
[3] art
[4]</p>

<p>each reality is 18 min so thats 10.8 hrs</p>

<h2 id="add-that-line-lol">add that line LOL</h2>

<pre><code>i just lost my cellphone

you can call me on robin's phone

</code></pre>

<p><strong>1040AM</strong></p>

<p>just got on BART
its cool I actually paid this time whoa</p>

<p>I think I&rsquo;m going to need to unlock the cards though both are tapped out. Who knows who cares.</p>

<p>Had a great time rehearsing with Robin and Jack last night in the ground floor outside the language department at Berkeley.</p>

<p>We got a lot done and drank some simpler times. I took a cliff bar from TJs and felt bad, cause that&rsquo;s my favorite grocery store. I relied on Tjs a lot over the years.</p>

<p>The play is going well but I really want to practice more to take it to the next level. I have an italian line as well as a latin one.</p>

<p>you&rsquo;ll rave about what&rsquo;s in the book</p>

<p>you&rsquo;ll read passages of the books</p>

<p>but you won&rsquo;t talk about it yourself</p>

<p>you use the books as a voice for you</p>

<p>and by reading you vicariously</p>

<p>live the passages of the author&rsquo;s imagination</p>

<p>who no doubt is well trained in written verse</p>

<p>and the author raves about what&rsquo;s in their books</p>

<p>but they won&rsquo;t speak about it themselves</p>

<p>=-=-=-=-=-</p>

<p><strong>202pm</strong></p>

<p>on mu first cup of coffee. I&rsquo;ve been slow today. Manic past few days, so slowly manic today.</p>

<p>Made it to the john art gallery, I love this place!!! there&rsquo;s new art here&hellip;. Brianna picked me up from Richmond and I dropped her off at law school,</p>

<p>I need graph paper</p>

<p>cutting the play scenes now</p>

<p>{ she bought the coffee :) }</p>

<hr />

<p><strong>227pm</strong></p>

<p>I feel like an artist, which right now means a fleshy prostitute of God.</p>

<p>how many genres of music can I fit in a 24 hour cycle?</p>

<p><strong>401 PM</strong></p>

<p>Had a good session at the art gallery, first weed hit in like 30 hours. 24 hours in I was starting to have an out of body experience that lasts a few hours.</p>

<p>its funny when theres diminishing returns on good manners</p>

<p>like when you&rsquo;re polite</p>

<p>your friend smokes you out every time</p>

<p>then</p>

<pre><code>never performed in her Capital
call me antisocial
I know its a phase
I dug myself into a pit
for the reps for the gains
mantra of a thousand
thousand thoughts
thousand humans before me in this space

she know I distracted
I know I devoted

perform in her Capital

when you go dark
you go light
light side of the mind
skateboard in my site
autocorrected to prostitute
my lappy gettin to know me
more than I know thyself
that the foundation
of all philosophy
hunny
hunny
bunny rabbit heart
blappin in the dark
scopin on the roof
cemetary with a noose
garden hose hit the snooze

<h1 id="would-you-fuck-a-robot">Would you fuck a robot ?</h1>

<hr />

<p>Sofia was the short story by bj novak</p>

<p>about a man returning the first sex bot with the capacity to love</p>

<p>and this female robot loved him and he still returned her</p>

<p>cause he&rsquo;s a self declared romantic</p>

<p>meaning where he knows it or not or is figuring it out</p>

<p>he&rsquo;d prefer to earn love, not get it shipped to your doorstep.</p>

<p>so I ask you, could you fall in love with a robot?</p>

dont spill bullshit like it different
I indifferent the way you speaking
bunch of variables taking control of your kingdom
pre frontal cortex double speak been peaking
I only see it when I don't get high
it too much so I get high all the time
sometimes
then bing n binge on books and pussy and beats
yeah mic, that's all you need that's all you need
forgive and forget forget to follow your dreams
