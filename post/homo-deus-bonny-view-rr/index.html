```
the first line of it
acid confession I said are you making a pass at me
we were high
up up in the tree
big moonlight
out up at an airbnb
tight
it was just a field a pond a river
we explored it all
she didn't want to go in the water
I went and splashed her
uh oh
they are missing and I know that oh

miss myself missin you
think about it in the river though
that was a little piece of old me
shut it down
I feel it like it was yesterday
time stops when I'm with you as of late
how long before it goes away damn

from plan z to plan a

holy shit
and the england kinda girl england
she rom baths too
phoebe yeah shit
loved it
same thing
thats what love do


at the end of the day
they're just waitresses waiting to die in this nation
I never wouldve predicted it
but then we went   
I fucking just cheated
I just fucking lost it

cam's couch ted's bed

and climbing through jack's window
```

rest in peace
rosanne cosby kramer wood allen man

im talking brother schoof
how he had no shoes

get in it
eat the icing if you wanna see your children
cause god is in everything
even time
even though

I pull out and cum on her shirt
her moby dick shirt
thats why Im freestyling moby dick all the time
I know
inside jokes wont get me far
but they make me laugh
and they get me to the bars
counting mintues when I waking up
when the next drink?
and I drink it up
everybody wanna think too much and I stink it up
whoooa !
fuck up every single track
cause Im with my friends
another musical track so versatile
going to the ends
whose a modern day beethoven
who I make love to I plead the fifth
I done focus
