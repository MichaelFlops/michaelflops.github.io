I woke up with a sore throat so it looks like Im getting sick? but it doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter much because I have so much adrenaline. I&amp;rsquo;m dressed as Fred right now, which is 100% cameron&amp;rsquo;s interview outfit that got him a job at Ebay.

<p>its been so hectic upon waking!</p>

<p>@ ted gus&rsquo;s - their dad came over so we power cleaned real wquick.</p>

<p>I woke up with a sore throat so it looks like Im getting sick? but it doesn&rsquo;t matter much because I have so much adrenaline. I&rsquo;m dressed as Fred right now, which is 100% cameron&rsquo;s interview outfit that got him a job at Ebay.</p>

<p>I feel more like Fred. just posted to reddit of some promo video we pumped out lat e last night</p>

<p>mostly excited cause chad&rsquo;s coming here around 4PM to film behind the scenes and ultimately other stuff as well. IT&rsquo;s GOING TO BE DOPE</p>

camtedGus's couch

kettle started day one

kettle's boiling conversation

cramped on a couch she gave me a book rec

I gave her moby dick

she said she didn't cum

usually from penetration

then made an exception

I came on her shirt

moby dick cotton situation

flyer at fisherman's wharf

suddenly I monk on lucy

darwin was good to me

darwin what good for me

fall in love or a watery tomb

run the water when I gotta use

jacks housemates mouth rinse

bad news, my shits in 4-5 places

my dick is for you

lets make it work I don't give a shit

<p>in the back of matt&rsquo;s prius. play today!!! I&rsquo;m kinda tired right now</p>

<p>we&rsquo;re rehearsing in the car and he&rsquo;s making a great kramer</p>

<p>18th and noe street is close to the moby dick bar</p>

<p>a homeless lady on haight street asked me for some money and I told her I didn&rsquo;t have a cent on me, and she ended up giving me her dollar, and we talked a bit and she said I deserve it more than her. I told her I loved her and would get her back one day.</p>

<p>and I said we&rsquo;ll end up in the same placedi</p>

brain is melting more than

got a lesson
from play
poetics 2

imma open the book
imma grow up then look
into your heart your soul
your cards left field that me
that I know
(I know)nothing
I know
my last line
so
thumb through
feeds for
tools grew
breakthrough
out of the blue
connective tissue go and connect it
turn it around think by to 7
burn that bound 2 lyric
damn it not the way you move
the fact you a gift
cause a gift you open
then don't fuck with it
I shouldn't've spoken
when I know this
too soon voltage
violate my pilgrimage
in only the right way

that me on the front page
look mom I made
commitment to a track
frost on a phone trapt
cost of freedom snack

that me look mom
commitment to a beat
commitment to me
not a good time to get high
when she get me high I get by
biographies of her favorite authors

no coments on nothing

(ch)
Trippy chris
trippy chris's room
bob's room
Bob's room
fallen in acid paradisio
pergatorio if I stay too long

whoever can learn my charts
can make music with me
jump on the typeface
istanbol loves san fran

I a hopells romantic
MILLIONS of people frantic
one hand typing spastic
good night,
delete it.
